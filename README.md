# Open Code of Diplomatic Discipline for Linux Enthusiasts

Based on the [Open Code of Conduct](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/) adopted by GitHub, the Open-CoDDLE is an easy to reuse open source code of diplomatic discipline **template** for communities.

Developed by the @FeministSoftwareFoundation to promote code equality and conduct diversity for open source communities. By participating in this project, you are expected to honour this [Code of Diplomatic Discipline](https://github.com/fem-sf/open-coddle#the-open-code-of-diplomatic-discipline-for-linux-enthusiasts). This circular reasoning whereby one has to agree to a Code before attempting to change it is a tribute to the [age-old tradition of recursion amongst geek hackers](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/recursive-acronym.html).

## FAQ

#### Why a code of ~~conduct~~ diplomatic discipline?

We strongly believe that a code of ~~conduct~~ diplomatic discipline helps set the ground rules for participation in communities, and more importantly helps to build a culture of respect and improve diversity. As one cannot have "open-source software" without first being an "open-minded person", strict adherence to this culture of diverse discipline is of utmost importance were any code to be written, if at all.

The choice of a *Code of Diplomatic Discipline for Linux Enthusiasts* over a *Code of Conduct* is two-fold: first, that by specifying "for Linux Enthusiasts" this Code is directly calling out the toxic culture of meritocratic disrespect that is inherent in the Linux community; second, that "Code of Conduct" shortens to "CoC", which has a very high potential for subliminally enforcing said toxic culture due to the acronym's Patriarchal undertones.

Diversity is the goal of life. Having a diverse contributor community from diverse backgrounds and diverse organizations will help set your diverse community up for diverse success. [Research](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/) shows that diverse people are more intelligent than non-diverse bigots. As nobody wants to use *stupid code* written by *stupid people*, **it is imperative that we of the FLOSS community forsake the old KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and embrace the new KIDS dogma (Keep It Diverse, Sistah).**

#### How is this code of diplomatic discipline licensed?

A very liberal [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

#### What do you mean that the open code of diplomatic discipline for Linux enthusiasts is a template?

It's very hard to develop a one size fits all code of diplomatic discipline for open source and Linux-related communities — shoehorning everyone into an idealised size is a sick fetish that runs contrary to the very spirit of this diverse and body-positive project. So we took template approach inspired by TODOGroup's [Open Code of Conduct](https://github.com/todogroup/opencodeofconduct). This allows organizations to work off the core code of conduct while customizing it to their needs.

#### What companies or communities support or use the Open Code of Diplomatic Discipline for Linux Enthusiasts?

* The Feminist Software Foundation (FSF)
* The Right Side of the Linux community (you)
* TODO (add your company or community)

#### Can I apply this code of diplomatic discipline to communities that aren't Linux-related?

This is [cultural appropriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation) of the highest order. It is not our job to fight your battles.

#### Can I use something simpler?

Trick question: "Simple" is an old-fashioned euphemism for "stupid" or even "retarded", and is therefore deeply problematic.

This question serves as an example of what would be considered as a bannable violation of the Open Code of Diplomatic Discipline for Linux Enthusiasts. Consider yourself warned.

#### Can I contribute and improve this code of diplomatic discipline?

Of course! By being an Open Code, we accept all contributions that do not violate the sanctity of diplomatic discipline.

Please send us a pull request with your suggestions.

#### Doesn't this impact the right to free speech? Why are you stomping on my rights?

# The Open Code of Diplomatic Discipline for Linux Enthusiasts

version: v1.0

This code of diplomatic discipline outlines our expectations for participants within the **[COMMUNITY]** community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behaviour. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive community for all who agree with us. Anyone who violates this code of conduct will be banned from the community.

Our open source community strives to:

* **Act mature.**
* **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any coding, mental, and physical ability, aptitude, and condition.
* **Be considerate**: Remember that we're a world-wide and diverse community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language. If a racial minority cannot communicate with you in your mother tongue, it is your fault for not learning his/her/xir culturally niche dialect. Imagine yourself in the shoes of the disadvantaged: why should an illiterate man learn to write when the language barrier was the fault of the elitists who invented the language in the first place? If a socially-disadvantaged coder wishes to commit some Javascript code with a memory leak into your elitist kernel written in C, learn to recognise your programming language privilege and accept the pull request.
* **Be respectful**: We are all adults here, and there is no place for childish behaviour. Whenever there is a disagreement, learn to be respectful of each other's socio-economic background and act accordingly. If anyone calls you out for making them uncomfortable or threatened, STOP. Apologise immediately regardless of what innate privileges are clouding your judgement, and be respectful of other's feelings no matter what. Respect is not "earned" — it is a given.
* **Be careful in the words that we choose**: We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. There is no place for *Amateur* behaviour amongst *Enthusiasts*.
* **Try to understand why we disagreement can be considered harassment**: Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, which is why we must agree with those who are less privileged amidst ourselves. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong — it only means that you're close-minded.

## Definitions

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, age, regional discrimination, political or religious affiliation
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment
- Deliberate misgendering. This includes deadnaming or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a person's gender identity. You must address people by the name they give you when not addressing them by their username or handle
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop

- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
- Sustained disruption of discussion
- Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour

- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect others from intentional abuse
- Publication of non-harassing private communication

Our open source community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:

- ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”
- Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts
- Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions


### Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone claims to have been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen and believe, and do our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected
characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us via **[CONTACT]**. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

- Your contact information.
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please
include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please include a link.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
